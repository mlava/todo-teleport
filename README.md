If you ever end your day with some of your {{[[TODO]]}} blocks in Roam still not {{[[DONE]]}}, this extension provides an easy way to send them to another daily note page to deal with then.

**New:**
- fixes for user reported issues with freezing
- allow Escape and Enter key usage in calendar picker
- add alternative command to change date tags in todos but not move their parent page
  - ie. change [[February 22nd, 2024]] to [[February 23rd, 2024]] within the block
- option to leave behind a blockref after teleporting a todo to another date
  - a separate option appears both in block context menu and command palette, and you could set a Roam Research hotkey to this option if that is your usual preference
- compatible with Roam Research Hotkeys

Using the Roam Research multi-block select (CTRL-m) choose the TODOs you want to teleport. If you only want to send one TODO to the future, feel free to skip this step!

You can trigger the teleport by right-clicking on the block's bullet icon and then selecting Plugins > Teleport TODOs. A datepicker dialogue box will come up. Choose the date and your TODOs will teleport to that page in your graph.

You can also trigger this extension via the Command Palette and 'Teleport TODOs'.

If you happen to select a block that you've DONE, never fear as it won't be sent anywhere: only incomplete TODOs will move. Further, empty blocks or those that don't contain a {{[[TODO]]}} won't move either. No accidentally sending important data to another day!
